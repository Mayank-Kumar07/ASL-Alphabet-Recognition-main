# ASL-Alphabet-Recognition-main
This repository contains the implementation of an American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system that identifies alphabet letters from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project aims to facilitate communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by translating ASL gestures into textual representation.
